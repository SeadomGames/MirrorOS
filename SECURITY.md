# Security Policy

We take security seriously at SeadomGames. Any impact on our users/developers security should be reported immediantly, and 
affected versions/code will be unshared and pulled to the "unsecure" branch untill an admin can verify and/or review the vunerabilty.

## Supported Versions


| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| v.b.01  | :x:                | 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you spot a vunlnerabilty, speak up! We rely on our developer community a lot. To report a vunerabilty, start a pull request to 
the "unsecure" branch. In the discription of the pull request, include where you found the vunerabilty and what it does. If the rest 
of the dev commuinty agrees with you, the file will be pulled to the "unsecure" branch and admins will do the rest. We'll also draft a security advisory. The branch diffrence is just to isolate the code.
